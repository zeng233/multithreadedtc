The **MultithreadedTC** framework was created to make it easier to test small concurrent abstractions. It enables test designers to guarantee a specific interleaving of two or more threads, even in the presence of blocking and timing issues.

**MultithreadedTC** was created at the University of Maryland by [Bill Pugh](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/) and [Nat Ayewah](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~ayewah). It has been used in a number of courses to test concurrent projects, and enable students to write their own test cases.
